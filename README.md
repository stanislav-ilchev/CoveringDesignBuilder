A (v,k,t)-covering design is a collection of k-element subsets, called blocks, of {1,2,â€¦,v}, such that any t-element subset is contained in at least one block. 
A (v, k, m, t)-lotto design is a v-set, V, of elements and a set B of k-element subsets (blocks) of V, 
so that for any m-subset M of V , there is a block B from B, for which |M intersected with B| >= t. 
L(v, k, m, t) denotes the smallest number of blocks in any (v, k, m, t)-lotto design.
In covering designs m = t so they are private cases of lotto designs.
